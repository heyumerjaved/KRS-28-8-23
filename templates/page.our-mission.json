We would head to the trails in nearby Rotorua, and I’d ride the longer trails with our older boys, whilst my wife would stay near the carpark with our youngest son on his balance bike. We all loved mountain biking, but we hated having to split up to do it – we had to find a better way.”<\/p><p>Dan knew that a rear mounted seat wouldn’t work on his full suspension bike, so he started looking at front mounted child seats – and he found two options suitable for mountain biking. But unfortunately, the first wouldn’t fit his bike, and the second was a permanent attachment which also risked scratching his pride and joy.<\/p><p>And that’s when co-founder, product designer and MTB Dad Tom Hayward stepped in. The brief was simple. To design a child bike seat for parents who have high end full-suspension bikes, and want to take their kids mountain biking with them.<\/p><p>“After several prototypes, and plenty of feedback from MTB families and bike retailers, we had a design that was working really well – and most importantly, parents and kids were loving it”<\/p><p>Fast forward a few months, and the first version of the shotgun seat was born, and a pre-order campaign helped launch the brand in New Zealand. In March 2018, our shotgun handlebar accessory was released, before investment was raised in February 2019, and our focus shifted to North America and Europe, and USA and UK distribution was secured.<\/p><p>In 2020, covid-19 fuelled a global bike boom, and our tow rope and ‘shred til bed’ kids book products launched. This was supported by strong growth in Europe, with distribution secured in a number of key markets. We also picked up the design and innovation award, and grew our team from 4 to 14 staff, including a number of off-shore team members.<\/p><p>In 2021, we shifted across town into our new 'shred-quarters', and released the shotgun pro, our e-bike compatible child seat with zero frame contact.<\/p><p>From our origins as a single-product business, we’re now stoked to be a leading brand in the emerging mountain biking with kids category, and we’re excited about raising the next generation of mountain bikers.<\/p>"
